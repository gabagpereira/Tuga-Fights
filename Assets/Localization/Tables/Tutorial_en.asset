      Battle Mode you choose a team and face off against each of the fighters\u2019
      opponents.\nIn Free Fight Mode you can pick any fighter and will face a random
      opponent from the opposite team."

    m_Localized: "The fighters\u2019 interface is composed of three elements. The
      stamina meter (yellow bar) shows their state; when it runs out, it means the
      fighter has been defeated and the opponent will be declared as the current
      round winner. The defence power meter (green bar) shows how efficient the fighter's
      blocking can be against potential punches. The light panels, when turned on,
      indicate the number of rounds won by the corresponding fighter during the current
      match."

    m_Localized: 'There are two groups of combat tactics: offensive and defensive.

      Among
      the offensive tactics you can use punches or kicks. Punches are only effective
      if your opponent is not blocking attacks, and they have a short recharging
      time.

      Kicks deal more damage; however, they take longer to recharge.'

    m_Localized: To defend yourself from your opponent's attacks you can choose either
      to block or dodge. Hold the blocking button to block attacks. If you are hit
      by punches while blocking you won't suffer any damage, but it will cause you
      to lose some defence power. When your defence power runs out, blocking will
      not be effective anymore. Dodging, on the other hand, does not require any
      defence power, but is a very short and quick move.

    m_Localized: If your defence power completely runs out, you will need to gain
      it back in order to make blocking effective again. You can win some defence
      power for every three seconds without suffering any damage, or by hitting your
      opponent three times consecutively.

    m_Localized: 'Each match is composed of two rounds. The fighter that gathers
      two victories will be declared as winner.

      If, by the end of the second
      round, both fighters are tied, an extra round will start, to determine the
      winner.'
